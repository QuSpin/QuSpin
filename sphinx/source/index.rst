Welcome to the Official QuSpin Documentation!
=============================================

QuSpin is an open-source Python package for exact diagonalization and quantum dynamics of arbitrary boson, fermion and spin many-body systems. QuSpin supports the use of various (user-defined) symmetries for one and higher-dimensional lattice systems, (imaginary) time evolution following arbitrary user-specified driving protocols, and constrained Hilbert spaces.

This page contains the documentation for the use of all public functions and classes contained in QuSpin. 

Check out these papers for a detailed tutorial:

    * `SciPost Phys. 7, 020 (2019) <https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys.7.2.020>`_.
