def FTLM_static_iteration(O_dict,E,V,Q_T,beta=0):
	"""Calculate iteration for Finite-Temperature Lanczos method.

	Here we give a brief overview of this method based on `arXiv:1111.5931 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5931>`_. 

	One would naively think that it would require full diagonalization to calculate thermodynamic expectation values 
	for a quantum system as one has to fully diagonalize the Hamiltonian to evaluate:

	.. math::
		\\langle O\\rangle_\\beta = \\frac{1}{Z}Tr\\left(e^{-\\beta H}O\\right)
	
	with the partition function defined as: :math:`Z=Tr\\left(e^{-\\beta H}\\right)`. The idea behind the 
	Finite-Temperature Lanczos Method (FTLM) is to use quantum typicality as well as Krylov subspaces to 
	simplify this calculation. Typicality states that the trace of an operator can be approximated as an average 
	of that same operator with random vectors in the Hilbert-space sampled with the Harr measure. As a corollary, it 
	is known that the fluctuations of this average for any finite sample set will converge to 0 as the size of 
	the Hilbert space increases. Mathematically this is expressed as:

	.. math::
		\\frac{1}{\\dim\\mathcal{H}}Tr\\left(e^{-\\beta H}O\\right)\\approx \\frac{1}{N_r}\\sum_r\\langle r| e^{-\\beta H}O |r\\rangle

	where :math:`|r\\rangle` is a random state from the Harr measure of hilbert space :math:`\\mathcal{H}` if the 
	Hamiltonian. An issue can occur when the temperature goes to zero as the overlap :math:`\\langle r| e^{-\\beta H}O |r\\rangle` will 
	be quite small for most states :math:`|r\\rangle`. Hence, this will require more random realizations to converge. Therefore, 
	this method is really only useful at high temperatures. Next, the idea is to use Lanczos to approximate the matrix exponential. 
	The eigenstates from the lanczos basis can effectively be inserted as an identity operator:

	.. math::
		\\frac{1}{\\dim\\mathcal{H}}Tr\\left(e^{-\\beta H}O\\right)\\approx \\frac{1}{N_r}\\sum_r\\langle r|e^{-\\beta H}O|r\\rangle\\approx \\frac{1}{N_r}\\sum_r\\sum_{i=1}^m e^{-\\beta\\epsilon^{(r)}_i}\\langle r|\\psi^{(r)}_i\\rangle\\langle\\psi^{(r)}_i|O|r\\rangle = \\frac{1}{N_r}\\sum_r \\langle O\\rangle_r \\equiv \\overline{\\langle O\\rangle_r}

	Now going back to the thermal expecation value, we can use the expression above to calculate :math:`\\frac{1}{Z}Tr\\left(e^{-\\beta H}O\\right)` 
	by noting that the partition function is simply the expecation value of the identity operator: :math:`Z=Tr\\left(e^{-\\beta H}I\\right)` and hence 
	the thermal expecation value is approximated by:

	.. math::
		\\langle O\\rangle_\\beta \\approx \\frac{\\overline{\\langle O\\rangle_r}}{\\overline{\\langle I\\rangle_r}}


	The idea behind this function is to generate the the expecation value :math:`\\langle O\\rangle_r` and :math:`\\langle I\\rangle_r`
	for a lanczos basis generated from an initial state :math:`|r\\rangle`. Therefore if the user would like to calculate the thermal expecation value all one 
	has to do call this function for each lanczos basis generated from a random state :math:`|r\\rangle`. 

	Notes
	-----
	* The amount of memory used by this function scales like: :math:`nN_{op}` with :math:`n` being the size of the full Hilbert space and :math:`N_{op}` is the number of input operators. 
	* FTLM does not converge very well at low temperatures, see function for low-temperature lanczos iterations. 
	* One has to be careful as typicality only applies to the trace operation over the entire Hilbert space. Using symmetries is possible, however it requires the user to keep track of the weights in the different sectors.


	Parameters
	-----------
	O_dict : dictionary of Python Objects
		These Objects must have a 'dot' method that calculates a matrix vector product on a numpy.ndarray[:], the effective shape of these objects should be (n,n). 
	E : array_like, (m,)
		Eigenvalues for the Krylov projection of some operator.
	V : array_like, (m,m)
		Eigenvectors for the Krylov projection of some operator.
	Q_T : iterator over rows of Q_T
		generator or ndarray that contains the lanczos basis associated with E, and V.  
	beta : scalar/array_like, any shape
		Inverse temperature values to evaluate.

	Returns
	--------
	Result_dict: dictionary
		A dictionary storying the results for a single iteration of the FTLM. The results are stored in numpy.ndarrays 
		that have the same shape as `beta`. The keys of `Result_dict` are the same as the keys in `O_dict` and the values 
		associated with the given key in `Result_dict` are the expectation values for the operator in `O_dict` with the same key.
	I_expt: numpy.ndarray, same shape as `beta`
		The expecation value of the identity operator for each beta. 


	Examples
	--------

	>>> beta = numpy.linspace(0,10,101)
	>>> E, V, Q_T = lanczos_full(H,v0,20)
	>>> Res,Id = FTLM_static_iteration(Obs_dict,E,V,Q_T,beta=beta)
