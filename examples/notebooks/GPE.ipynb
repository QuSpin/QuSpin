    "where $J$ is the hopping matrix element, $\\kappa_i$ is the harmonic trap 'frequency' [we use the subindex $i$ to indicate an initial value which will play a role later on], and $U$ -- the interaction strength. The lattice sites are labelled by $j=0,\\dots,L-1$, and $j_0$ is the centre of the 1d chain. We set the lattice constant to unity, and use open boundary conditions.\n",

In the case of imaginary evolution, this state can often be arbitrary, but needs to possess the same symmetries as the true GPE ground state. Here, we choose the ground state of the single-particle Hamiltonian for an initial state, and normalise it to one particle per site. We also define the imaginary time vector `tau`. This array has to contain sufficiently long times so that we make sure we obtain the long imaginary time limit $\\tau\\to\\infty$, as required by Eq.~\\eqref{eq:GPE_imag}. Since imaginary time evolution is not unitary, QuSpin will be normalising the vector every $\\tau$-step. Thus, one also needs to make sure these steps are small enough to avoid convergence problems of the ODE solver.\n",

The parameters of the ODE are passed using the keyword argument `f_params=GPE_params`. To ensure the normalisation of the state at each $\\tau$-step we use the flag `imag_time=True`. Real-valued output can be specified by `real=True`. Last, we request `evolve()` to create a generator object using the keyword argument `iterate=True`. Many of the keyword arguments of `evolve()` are the same as in the `H.evolve()` method of the `hamiltonian class`: for instance, one can choose a specific SciPy solver and its arguments, or the solver's absolute and relative tolerance.\n",

    "Next, we use our GPE ground state, to time-evolve it in real time according to the trap widening protocol hard-coded into the single-particle Hamiltonian. We proceed analogously -- first we define the real-time GPE and the time vector. In defining the GPE function, we split the ODE into a time-independent static part and a time-dependent dynamic part. The single-particle Hamiltonian for the former is accessed using the `hamiltonian` attribute `Hsp.static` which returns a sparse matrix. We can then manually add the non-linear cubic mean-field interaction term. In order to access the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian, and evaluate it, we loop over the dynamic list `Hsp.dynamic`, reading off the corresponding operator `Hd` together with the time-dependent function `f` which multiplies it, and its arguments `f_args`. Last, we multiply the final output vector by the Schr\\\"odinger $-i$, which ensures the unitarity of for real-time evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform real-time evolution we once again use the `evolve()` function. This time, however, since the solution of the GPE is anticipated to be complex-valued, and because we do not do imaginary time, we do not need to pass the flags `real` and `imag_time`. Instead, we decided to show the flags for the relative and absolute tolerance of the solver."
