QuSpin: Quantum Many-Body Dynamics 
==================================

QuSpin is an open-source Python package for exact diagonalization and quantum dynamics of arbitrary boson, fermion and spin many-body systems. QuSpin supports the use of various (user-defined) symmetries for one and higher-dimensional lattice systems, (imaginary) time evolution following arbitrary user-specified driving protocols, constrained Hilbert spaces, and parallel sparse linear algebra tools.

This page contains the Documentation for the use of all public functions and classes contained in QuSpin. 

Check out these tutorial papers, the :ref:`example_scripts-label`, and :ref:`jypiter_notebooks-label` for a detailed introduction:
