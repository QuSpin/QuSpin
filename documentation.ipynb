    "\n",
    "QuSpin is a python library which wraps Scipy, Numpy, and custom Cython libraries together to do state-of-the art exact diagonalization calculations on one-dimensional interacting spin, fermion and boson chains/ladders. The interface allows the user to define any many-body (and single particle) Hamiltonian which can be constructed from single-particle operators. It also gives the user the flexibility of accessing many symmetries in 1d. Moreover, there is a convenient built-in way to specifying the time dependence of operators in the Hamiltonian, which is interfaced with user-friendly routines to solve the time dependent Schrödinger equation numerically. All the Hamiltonian data is stored either using Scipy's [sparse matrix](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html) library for sparse Hamiltonians or dense Numpy [arrays](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/index.html) which allows the user to access any powerful Python scientific computing tools.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **automatic install**\n",
    "\n",
    "The latest version of the package has the compiled modules written in [Cython](cython.org) which has made the code far more portable across different platforms. We will support precompiled version of the package for Linux, OS X and Windows 64-bit systems. The automatic installation of QuSpin requires the Anaconda package manager for Python. Once Anaconda has been installed, all one has to do to install QuSpin is run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ conda install -c weinbe58 quspin\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will install the latest version on your computer. Right now the package is in its beta stages and so it may not be available for installation on all platforms using this method. In such a case one can also manually install the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **manual install**\n",
    "\n",
    "To install QuSpin manually, download the source code either from the [master](https://github.com/weinbe58/QuSpin/archive/master.zip) branch, or by cloning the git repository. In the top directory of the source code you can execute the following commands from bash:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python setup.py install \n",
    "```\n",
    "or Windows command line:\n",
    "```\n",
    "setup.py install\n",
    "```\n",
    "For the manual installation you must have all the prerequisite python packages: [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), and [joblib](https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/) installed. We recommend [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) to manage your python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "When installing the package manually, if you add the flag ```--record install.txt```, the location of all the installed files will be output to install.txt which stores information about all installed files. This can prove useful when updating the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **updating the package**\n",
    "\n",
    "To update the package with Anaconda, all one has to do is run the installation command again.\n",
    "\n",
    "To safely update a manually installed version of QuSpin, one must first manually delete the entire package from the python 'site-packages/' directory. In Unix, provided the flag ```--record install.txt``` has been used in the manual installation, the following command is sufficient to completely remove the installed files: ```cat install.txt | xargs rm -rf```. In Windows, it is easiest to just go to the folder and delete it from Windows Explorer. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Basic package usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "All the calculations done with QuSpin happen through [hamiltonians](hamiltonian-class). The hamiltonian is a type which uses Numpy and Scipy matrices to store the quantum Hamiltonian operator. Time-independent operators are summed together into a single static matrix, while each time-dependent operator is stored separatly along with the time-dependent coupling in front of it (operators sharing the same time-dependence are a also summen together into a single matrix). Whenever the user wants to perform an operation invonving a time-dependent operator, the time dependence is evaluated on the fly by specifying the argument ```time```. The user can initialize the hamiltonian types with Numpy arrays or Scipy matrices. Apart from this, we provide a user-friendly representation for constructing the Hamiltonian matrices for many-body operators. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many-body operators in QuSpin are defined by a string of letters representing the operator types, together with a list which holds the indices for the sites that each operator acts at on the lattice. For example, in a spin system we can represent any multi-spin operator as:\n",
    "\n",
    "|      operator string        |      site-coupling list          |               spin operator                 |\n",
    "|:-----------------:|:------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|\n",
    "|\"$\\mu_1,\\dots,\\mu_n$\"  |$[J,i_1,\\dots,i_n]$ |$J\\sigma_{i_1}^{\\mu_1}\\cdots\\sigma_{i_n}^{\\mu_n}$|\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu_i$ can be $x$, $y$, $z$, $+$, or $-$. Then $\\sigma_{i_1}^{\\mu_1}$ is the Pauli spin operator acting on lattice site $i_n$. This gives the full range of possible spin-1/2 operators that can be constructed. By default, ```hamiltonian``` will use the sigma matrices ${\\vec\\sigma}$. For different systems, there are different types of operators. To see the available operators for a given type of system check out the [basis](#basis-objects) classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **constructing hamiltonians**\n",
    "The Hamiltonian is constructed as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "H = hamiltonian(static_list,dynamic_list,**kwargs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where ```static_list``` and ```dynamic_list``` are lists which have the following format for many-body operators:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "static_list =  [[opstr_1,[indx_11,...,indx_1m]                   ],...]\n",
    "dynamic_list = [[opstr_1,[indx_11,...,indx_1n],func_1,func_1_args],...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "To use Numpy arrays or Scipy matrices the syntax is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "static_list  = [[opstr_1,[indx_11,...,indx_1m]                   ], matrix_2                    ,...]\n",
    "dynamic_list = [[opstr_1,[indx_11,...,indx_1n],func_1,func_1_args],[matrix_2,func_2,func_2_args],...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the definition of the dynamic list, ```func``` is the python function which goes in front of the matrix or operator given in the same list. ```func_args``` is a list of the all additional function arguments such that the function itself is evaluated as: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "f_val = func(t,*func_args)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### keyword arguments (kwargs):\n",
    "The ```**kwargs``` give extra information about the Hamiltonian. There is a variety of different features one can input here, and which one to choose depends on what Hamiltonian one would like to create. These arguments are used to specify symmetry blocks, give a shape, provide the floating point type to store the matrix elements with, disable automatic checks on the magnetisation, symemtries and the hermiticity of the hamiltonian, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**providing a shape:**\n",
    "To construct many-body operators, one must either specify the number of lattice sites with ```N=...``` or pass in a basis object as ```basis=...```, more about basis objects can be found [here](#basis-objects). One can also specify the shape using the ```shape=...``` keyword argument. For input lists which contain matrices only, the shape does not have to be specified. If empty lists are given, then either one of the previous options must be provided to the ```hamiltonian``` constructor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Numpy dtype:**\n",
    "The user can specify the numpy data type ([dtype](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.dtype.html)) to store the matrix elements in. It supports ```float32```, ```float64```, ```float128```(depricated as of v0.2.1), ```complex64```, ```complex128```, and ```complex256```(depricated as of v0.2.1). The default type is ```complex128```. To specify the ```dtype``` use the dtype keyword argument:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "H=hamiltonian(...,dtype=numpy.float32,...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that not all platforms and all of Scipy and Numpy functions support ```dtype``` ```float128``` and ```complex256```.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \n",
    "constructing the hamiltonian object of the transverse field Ising model with time-dependent field for a $10$-site chain:\n",

    "```\n",
    "Notice that one needs to include both ```'-z+'``` and ```'+z-'``` operators to make sure the Hamiltonian is hermitian. If one forgets about this, there is still the automatic hermiticity check which raises an error, see the optional flag ```check_herm``` in the hamiltonian object class organisation [here](#hamiltonian-class) which is set to ```True``` by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **using basis objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "Basis objects are another very useful type included in QuSpin: they provide all of the functionality which calculates the matrix elements from the operator string representation of many-body operators. On top of this, they have been programmed to calculate the matrix elements in different symmetry blocks of the many-body Hamiltonian with the help of optional flags. To use a basis object to construct the Hamiltonian, one simply uses the basis keyword argument:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "H = hamiltonian(static_list,dynamic_list,...,basis=basis,...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "More information about basis objects can be found in the [basis objects](#basis-objects) section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using basis objects when multiple separate Hamiltonians, which share the same symmetries, need to be constructed. One can either construct a basis by calling the constructors, or each hamiltonian object stores a reference to its basis as the attribute `H.basis`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **using symmetries**\n",
    "Adding symmetries is easy and versatile: one can either just add extra keyword arguments to the initialization of ```hamiltonian``` or, when one initializes a ```basis``` object one can build in the desired symmetries. By default, ```hamiltonian``` uses spin-1/2 Pauli operators and 1d-symmetries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The available symmetries for a spin chain in 1d are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* magnetization symmetries: \n",
    " *  ```Nup=0,1,...,L # pick single magnetization sector```\n",
    " * ```Nup = [0,1,...] # pick list of magnetization sectors (e.g. all even ones)```\n",
    "* parity symmetry: ```pblock = +/- 1```\n",
    "* spin inversion symmetry: ```zblock = +/- 1```\n",
    "* (spin inversion)*(parity) symmetry: ```pzblock = +/- 1 ```\n",
    "* spin inversion on sublattice A (even sites, first site of chain is even): ```zAblock = +/- 1```\n",
    "* spin inversion on sublattice B (odd sites): ```zAblock = +/- 1```\n",
    "* translational symmetry: ```kblock = ...,-1,0,1,.... # all integers available```\n",
    "\n",
    "The symmetries can be used like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "H = hamiltonian(static_list,dynamic_list,L,Nup=Nup,pblock=pblock,...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the user passes the symmetries into the ```hamiltonian``` constructor, the constructor first creates a [spin_basis_1d](spin\\_basis\\_1d) object for the given symmetries, and then uses that object to construct the matrix elements. Because of this, if one needs to construct multiple hamiltonian objects in the same symmetry block, it is more efficient to first construct the ```basis``` object and then use it to construct all different Hamiltonians:\n",
